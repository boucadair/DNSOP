      additional information about the cause of blocking access to a
      domain.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>There are many reasons that a DNS query may be blocked, the following
      discusses some of the reasons:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Various network security services are provided by Enterprise
          networks to protect endpoints (e.g,. Hosts, IoT devices).
          Network-based security solutions such as firewalls (FW) and
          Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) rely on network traffic
          inspection to implement perimeter-based security policies. The
          network security services may for example prevent malware download,
          block known malicious URLs, block phishing sites etc. These network
          security services act on DNS requests originating from endpoints.
          For example, DNS Firewalls, a method of expressing DNS response
          policy information inside specially constructed DNS zones, known as
          Response Policy Zones (RPZs) allows DNS servers to modify DNS
          responses in real time to stop access to malware and phishing
          domains. Note that some of the commonly known types of malware are
          viruses, worms, trojans, bots, ransomware, backdoors, spyware, and
          adware.</t>

          <t>Network devices in a home network offer network security to
          protect the devices connected to the home network by performing
          DNS-based content filtering. The network security service may for
          example block access to domains to enforce parental control, block
          access to malware sites etc.</t>

          <t>ISPs typically block access to access to domains due to an
          external requirement imposed by an external entity (e.g., Law
          Enforcement Agency) by performing DNS-based content filtering.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The typical mechanisms to block a DNS query and their limitations are
      illustrated below:<list style="symbols">
          <t>The DNS response is forged providing IP addresses that points to
          a HTTP(S) server alerting the end user of the reason for blocking
          access to the domain (e.g., malware). The extended error code
          "Forged answer" defined in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-extended-error"></xref> can be used by the
          client to identify the DNS response is forged. When a HTTP(S)
          enabled domain is blocked, the network security device presents a
          block page instead of the HTTP response from the content provider.
          If a HTTP enabled domain is blocked, the network security device
          intercepts the HTTP request and returns a block page over HTTP. If a
          HTTPS enabled domain is blocked, the block page is also served over
          HTTPS. In order to return a block page over HTTPS, MITM is enabled
          on endpoints by generating a local root certificate and an
          accompanying (local) public/private key pair. The local root
          certificate is installed on the endpoint, and the network security
          device(s) store a copy of the private key. During the TLS handshake,
          the network security device modifies the certificate provided by the
          server and (re)signs it with the private key from the local root
          certificate. <list style="symbols">
              <t>However, configuring the local root certificate on endpoints
              is not viable option in several deployments like Home networks,
              Schools, Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) and Small/ Medium
              Enterprise (SME). </t>

              <t>Enterprise networks do not assume that all devices in their
              network are managed by the IT team or Mobile Device Management
              (MDM) devices, especially in the quite common BYOD ("Bring Your
              Own Device") scenario. The local root certificate cannot be
              installed on IoT devices without a device management tool. In
              this case, the browser will encounter HTTPS certificate error
              when the browser is redirected via DNS to a web page hosted to
              display the block page. The typical errors are "The security
              certificate presented by this website was not issued by a
              trusted certificate authority" (Internet Explorer/Edge"), "The
              site's security certificate is not trusted" (Chrome), "This
              Connection is Untrusted" (Firefox), &ldquo;Safari can't verify
              the identity of the website&hellip;&rdquo; (Safari on MacOS)".
              </t>

              <t>An end user does not know why the connection was reset and,
              consequently, may repeatedly try to unsuccessfully reach the
              domain. Frustrated, the end user may use insecure interfaces to
              reach the domain, potentially compromising both security and
              privacy. Furthermore, certificate errors train users to click
              through certificate errors, which is poor security practice. To
              eliminate the need for an end user to click through certificate
              errors, an end user may manually install a local root
              certificate <xref target="Chrome-Install-Cert"></xref> on a host
              device . Doing so, however, is also poor security practice as it
              creates a security vulnerability that may be exploited by a
              man-in-the-middle attack. When the manually installed local root
              certificate expires, user has to again manually install the new
              local root certificate.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The DNS response is forged to provide a NXDOMAIN response to
          cause the DNS lookup to terminate in failure. In this case, an end
          user does not know why the domain cannot be reached, and may
          repeatedly try to unsuccessfully reach the domain. Frustrated, the
          end user may use insecure interfaces to reach the domain,
          potentially compromising both security and privacy.</t>

          <t>The extended error codes Blocked, Censored and Filtered defined
          in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-extended-error"></xref> can be
          returned by the DNS server to provide additional information about
          the cause of an DNS error. These extended error codes does not
          suffer from the above limitations but the user still does not know
          the exact reason or is aware of the exact entity blocking the access
          to the domain. For example, a DNS server may block access domain
          based on the content category like "Adult Content" to enforce
          parental control, "Violence &amp; Terrorism" due to an external
          requirement imposed by an external entity (e.g., Law Enforcement
          Agency) etc. The content categories for domains cannot be
          standardized because the classification of domains into content
          categories is vendor specific, typically ranges from 40 to 100 types
          of categories depending on the vendor and the categories keep
          evolving. Further, the threat data used to categorize domains may
          seldom mis-classify domains (e.g., Domains wrongly classified as DGA
          (Domain generation algorithm) by deep learning techniques, domain
          wrongly classified as phishing due to crowd souring, new domains not
          categorized by the threat data). The end user needs to know the
          contact details of the IT/InfoSec team to raise a complaint.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This document focuses on addressing the above limitations by defining
      an method to return a URL that provides additional information about the
      cause of blocking access to a domain.</t>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>This document makes use of the terms defined in <xref
      target="RFC8499"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-ter"></xref>.</t>

      <t>'DoH/DoT' refers to DNS-over-HTTPS and/or DNS-over-TLS.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Method to return the error page URL">
      <t>The mechanism for providing additional information about the cause of
      blocking access to a domain is from the HTTPS DNS record <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https"></xref>. This HTTPS record in the
      "Service Form" provides the URL that gives additional information about
      the cause of blocking access to a domain. In order to convey a error
      page URL for a "Forged Answer" extended error, a HTTPS record MUST
      contain the "errorurl" (<xref target="IANA"></xref>). The service
      parameter key "errorurl" MUST only be processed by the DNS client for a
      "Forged Answer" extended error code and MUST be ignored for any other
      type of DNS response.</t>

      <t>The following example shows a record containing a error page URL, the
      HTTPS record is returned along with the "Forged Answer" extended error
      code.</t>

      <t><figure align="center" anchor="ex" title="Example 1">

    <section title="ERROR Page ">
      <t>The following text outlines the recommended contents of a error
      page.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The exact reason for blocking access to the domain. If the domain
          is blocked based on threat data, the threat type associated with the
          blocked domain can be provided to the end user. For example, the
          reason can indicate the type of malware blocked like spyware and the
          damage it can do the security and privacy of the user.</t>

          <t>The domain name blocked.</t>

          <t>The entity (or organization) blocking the access to the domain
          and contact details of the IT/InfoSec team to raise a complaint.</t>

          <t>The blocked error page MUST NOT include Ads.</t>

          <t>The blocked error page MUST NOT include dynamic content.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Usability considerations">
      <t>If the error page is displayed in a language not known to the end
      user, browser extension to translate to user's native language can be
      used. For example, "Google Translate" extension <xref
      target="Chrome-Translate"></xref> provided by Google on Chrome can be
      used by the user to translate the error page. The "Google Translate"
      extension automatically detects if the language of a page is different
      from the language the user has selected. If it is in a different
      language, a banner appears at the top of the page. The user can click on
      the Translate button in the banner to have all the text on the page
      appear in the language selected by the user.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Security considerations in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-extended-error"></xref> need to be taken into
      consideration. Unless the DNS response that conveys the URL that
      provides additional information about the cause of blocking access to a
      domain is sent over DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) <xref target="RFC8484"></xref>
      or DNS-over-TLS (DoT) <xref target="RFC7858"></xref>, the DNS response
      is susceptible to forgery. DNS stub resolver MUST NOT fetch the URL
      unless DNS messages are exchanged over DoT/DoH. Bad actors can host
      DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers, and claim the servers offer
      privacy and filtering capability to block malware domains but exactly do
      the opposite to invade the security and privacy of the end user. This
      attack can be mitigated if and only if the endpoint selects DoT/DoH
      servers hosted by well-known organizations (e.g., ISPs, organization for
      which a user works etc.) or the user selects DoT/DoH server with
      filtering capability pre-configured in the OS/Browser. The DNS client
      can learn the filtering capability of the DoH/DoT server using <xref
      target="I-D.reddy-add-server-policy-selection"></xref>. <xref
      target="I-D.reddy-add-server-policy-selection"></xref> also discusses
      how a DNS client can authenticate it is connecting to a DoH/DoT server
      hosted by a specific organization (e.g., ISP). This information is
      cryptographically signed to attest its authenticity. It is particularly
      useful when the DoH/DoT server is insecurely discovered and prevents the
      client from connecting to an attackers DoH/DoT server.</t>

      <t>The URL providing additional information about the cause of blocking
      access to a domain MUST only serve static content to limit the risk of
      security threats from dynamic content (e.g., malicious Java Script). The
      client MUST reject the URL if the scheme is not "https". DNSSEC signing
      and validation is not possible for the HTTPS record returning the error
      page URL along with the "Forged Answer" extended error.</t>
