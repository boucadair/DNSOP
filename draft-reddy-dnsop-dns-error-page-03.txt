Abstract

   When a DNS server filters a query the response conveys no detailed
   explanation of why the query was blocked, leading to end-user
   confusion.  This document defines a method to return an URL that
   explains the reason the DNS query was filtered.

1.  Introduction

   DNS filters are deployed for a variety of reasons including endpoint
   security, parental filtering, and filtering required by law
   enforcement.  These are discussed in more detail below:

   o  Various network security services are provided by Enterprise
      networks to protect endpoints (e.g., Hosts including IoT devices).
      Network-based security solutions such as firewalls and Intrusion
      Prevention Systems (IPS) rely on network traffic inspection to
      implement perimeter-based security policies.  The network security
      services may, for example, prevent malware download, block known
      malicious domains, block phishing sites, etc.  These network
      security services act on DNS queries originating from endpoints.
      For example, DNS firewalls, a method of expressing DNS response
      policy information inside specially constructed DNS zones, known
      as Response Policy Zones (RPZs) allows DNS servers to modify DNS
      responses in real time to stop access to malware and phishing
      domains.  Note that some of the commonly known types of malware
      are viruses, worms, trojans, bots, ransomware, backdoors, spyware,
      and adware.

   o  Network devices in a home network offer network security to
      protect the devices connected to the home network by performing
      DNS-based content filtering.  The network security service may,

Internet-Draft        DNS Access Denied Error Page           August 2020


      for example, block access to specific domains to enforce parental
      control, block access to malware sites, etc.

   o  ISPs typically block access to some domains due to a requirement
      imposed by an external entity (e.g., Law Enforcement Agency) by
      performing DNS-based content filtering.

   DNS responses can be filtered by sending a bogus ("forged") A or AAAA
   response, NXDOMAIN error or empty answer, or an extended error code
   defined in [I-D.ietf-dnsop-extended-error].  Each of these have
   advantages and disadvantages, discussed below:

   1.  The DNS response is forged providing IP addresses that points to
       a HTTP(S) server alerting the end user of the reason for blocking
       access to the domain (e.g., malware).  When a HTTP(S) enabled
       domain name is blocked, the network security device presents a
       block page instead of the HTTP response from the content
       provider.  If an HTTP enabled domain name is blocked, the network
       security device intercepts the HTTP request and returns a block
       page over HTTP.  If an HTTPS enabled domain is blocked, the block
       page is also served over HTTPS.  In order to return a block page
       over HTTPS, man in the middle (MITM) is enabled on endpoints by
       generating a local root certificate and an accompanying (local)
       public/private key pair.  The local root certificate is installed
       on the endpoint, and the network security device(s) store a copy
       of the private key.  During the TLS handshake, the network
       security device modifies the certificate provided by the server
       and (re)signs it with the private key from the local root
       certificate.

       *  However, configuring the local root certificate on endpoints
          is not viable option in several deployments like Home
          networks, Schools, Small Office/Home Office (SOHO), and Small/
          Medium Enterprise (SME).  In these cases, the typical behavior
          is that the forged DNS response directs the user towards a
          server hosted to display the block page which breaks the TLS
          connection.  For web-browsing this then results in an HTTPS
          certificate error message indicating that a secure connection
          could not be established, which gives no information to the
          end-user about the reason for the error.  The typical errors
          are "The security certificate presented by this website was
          not issued by a trusted certificate authority" (Internet
          Explorer/Edge"), "The site's security certificate is not
          trusted" (Chrome), "This Connection is Untrusted" (Firefox),
          "Safari can't verify the identity of the website..." (Safari
          on MacOS)".

       *  Enterprise networks do not assume that all the devices
          connected to their network are managed by the IT team or
          Mobile Device Management (MDM) devices, especially in the
          quite common BYOD ("Bring Your Own Device") scenario.  In
          addition, the local root certificate cannot be installed on
          IoT devices without a device management tool.

       *  An end user does not know why the connection was reset and,
          consequently, may repeatedly try to unsuccessfully reach the
          domain.  Frustrated, the end user may use insecure interfaces
          to reach the domain, potentially compromising both security
          and privacy.  Furthermore, certificate errors train users to
          click through certificate errors, which is poor security
          practice.  To eliminate the need for an end user to click
          through certificate errors, an end user may manually install a
          local root certificate [Chrome-Install-Cert] on a host device.
          Doing so, however, is also poor security practice as it
          creates a security vulnerability that may be exploited by a
          MITM attack.  When the manually installed local root
          certificate expires, the user has to (again) manually install
          the new local root certificate.

   2.  The DNS response is forged to provide a NXDOMAIN response to
       cause the DNS lookup to terminate in failure.  In this case, an
       end user does not know why the domain cannot be reached, and may
       repeatedly try to unsuccessfully reach the domain.  Frustrated,
       the end user may use insecure interfaces to reach the domain,
       potentially compromising both security and privacy.

   3.  The extended error codes Blocked, Censored, and Filtered defined
       in [I-D.ietf-dnsop-extended-error] can be returned by the DNS
       server to provide additional information about the cause of an
       DNS error.  If the extended error code "Forged answer" defined in
       [I-D.ietf-dnsop-extended-error] is returned by the DNS server,
       the client can identify the DNS response is forged and the reason
       for HTTPS certificate error.  These extended error codes do not
       suffer from the limitations discussed in (1) and (2) but the user
       still does not know the exact reason nor the user is aware of the
       exact entity blocking the access to the domain.  For example, a
       DNS server may block access domain based on the content category
       like "Adult Content" to enforce parental control, "Violence &
       Terrorism" due to an external requirement imposed by an external
       entity (e.g., Law Enforcement Agency), etc.  The content
       categories for domains cannot be standardized because the
       classification of domains into content categories is vendor
       specific, typically ranges from 40 to 100 types of categories
       depending on the vendor and the categories keep evolving.
       Further, the threat data used to categorize domains may sometimes



Reddy, et al.           Expires February 13, 2021               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        DNS Access Denied Error Page           August 2020


       mis-classify domains (e.g., Domains wrongly classified as DGA
       (Domain Generation Algorithm) by deep learning techniques, domain
       wrongly classified as phishing due to crowd sourcing, new domains
       not categorized by the threat data, etc.).  The end user needs to
       know the contact details of the IT/InfoSec team to raise a
       complaint.

   No matter which type of response is generated (forged IP address,
   NXDOMAIN or empty answer, or an extended error code), the user who
   generated the query has little chance to understand which entity
   filtered the query, how to report a mistake in the filter, or why the
   entity filtered it at all.  This document describes a mechanism to
   provide a URL which, when accessed, provides such information to the
   user.

   One of the other benefits of this document is eliminating the need to
   "spoof" block pages for HTTPS resources, as the block page no longer
   needs to create a signed certificate when blocking a destination.
   This avoids the need to install an local root certificate authority
   on those IT-managed devices.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499] and
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-ter].

   'DoH/DoT' refers to DNS-over-HTTPS and/or DNS-over-TLS.

3.  Error page URL EDNS0 option format

   This draft uses an EDNS0 ([RFC6891]) option to include the URL that
   gives additional information about the cause of blocking access to a
   domain in a DNS response.  The option is structured as follows:

      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Field definition details:

   o  OPTION-CODE, 2-octets/16-bits (defined in [RFC6891]]), for Error
      page URL is TBD.  [RFC Editor: change TBD to the proper code once
      assigned by IANA.]

   o  OPTION-LENGTH, 2-octets/16-bits ((defined in [RFC6891]]) contains
      the length of the payload (everything after OPTION-LENGTH) in
      octets.  The variability of the option length stems from the
      variable-length ERROR-PAGE-URL and ERROR-PAGE-SIG fields.

   o  ERROR-PAGE-URL, a variable length, UTF-8 encoded [RFC5198], text
      field that will hold the URL that gives additional information
      about the cause of blocking access to a domain.  The ERROR-PAGE-
      URL field MUST NOT be zero octets in length.  The field MUST be
      null terminated.

   o  ERROR-PAGE-SIG-ALG, 16-bits, which is the signature algorithm used
      to generate the signature for the entire DNS response message.

   o  ERROR-PAGE-SIG, a variable length, field that will hold the
      signature of the entire DNS response message.  The field is
      represented as a Base64 encoding of the signature.  The signature
      generation process is discussed in Section 5.

   The Error page URL option can be included in error responses
   SERVFAIL, NXDOMAIN or REFUSED to a query that includes OPT Pseudo-RR
   [RFC6891].

   If the URI template is "https://block.example.net/block-page={target-
   domain}" for the HTTPS server returning the error page and access to
   the target domain "example.com" is blocked by the DoH/DoT server, the
   DoH/DoT server replaces the string "{target-domain}" in the template
   with the base64url-encoded target domain [RFC4648].  In the above



Reddy, et al.           Expires February 13, 2021               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        DNS Access Denied Error Page           August 2020


   example, the error page URL will be "https://block.example.net/block-
   page=ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20".

4.  Error page URL Processing

   The DNS client MUST follow the following rules to process the Error
   page URL EDNS0 option:

   o  The Error page URL EDNS0 option is susceptible to forgery.  In
      order to defend against this attack the DNS client MUST NOT
      process the DNS response with Error page URL EDNS0 option unless
      DNS messages exchanged are cryptographically protected using DoH/
      DoT.

   o  If an DNS client has enabled opportunistic privacy profile
      (Section 5 of [RFC8310]) for DoT, the DNS client will either
      fallback to an encrypted connection without authenticating the DNS
      server provided by the local network or fallback to clear text
      DNS, and cannot exchange encrypted DNS messages.  The fallback
      adversely impacts security and privacy.  If the DNS client has
      enabled opportunistic privacy profile for DoT, the client MUST NOT
      process the DNS response with Error page URL EDNS0 option.

   o  If an DNS client has enabled strict privacy profile (Section 5 of
      [RFC8310]) for DoT, the DNS client requires an encrypted
      connection and successful authentication of the DNS server; this
      mitigates both passive eavesdropping and client redirection (at
      the expense of providing no DNS service if an encrypted,
      authenticated connection is not available).  If the DNS client has
      enabled strict privacy profile for DoT, the client can process the
      DNS response with Error page URL EDNS0 option.  Note that the
      strict and opportunistic privacy profiles as defined in [RFC8310]
      only applies to DoT protocol, there has been no such distinction
      made for DoH protocol.

   o  If the DNS response has more than one Error page URL EDNS0 option,
      the DNS client MUST discard multiple Error page URL EDNS0 options
      in the DNS response.

   o  The Error page URL EDNS0 option MUST be processed by the DNS
      client for a "Censored", "Blocked" or "Filtered" extended error
      codes and MUST be ignored for any other type of extended DNS error
      code.  When "Censored", "Blocked" or "Filtered" extended error
      code is returned in conjunction with an Error page URL EDNS0
      option, any other resource records in the answer MUST be ignored
      by clients supporting this specification.

Internet-Draft        DNS Access Denied Error Page           August 2020


   o  If the DoH/DoT server does not offer DNS filtering service (e.g.,
      prevent access to malware sites or objectionable content (e.g.,
      legal obligation)), the DNS client MUST discard the Error page URL
      EDNS0 option.  The mechanism discussed in
      [I-D.reddy-add-server-policy-selection] can be used by the DNS
      client to assess whether the DoH/DoT server performs DNS-based
      content filtering.

   o  If the value of the variable in the error page URL does not match
      the original QNAME in the DNS request, the DNS client MUST discard
      the Error page URL EDNS0 option.

   o  If the Error page URL EDNS0 option is included in a NOERROR RCODE
      message, the DNS client MUST discard the Error page URL EDNS0
      option.

   o  The DNS client MUST reject the error page URL if the scheme is not
      "https".

   o  The DNS client verifies the signature in the ERROR-PAGE-SIG field
      following the mechanism discussed in Section 5.  If the signature
      is valid, the client can positively identify that the Error page
      URL EDNS0 option has been generated by the DoH/DoT server and the
      DoH/DoT server did not forward the Error Page URL EDNS0 option
      from an upstream resolver.  Otherwise, the DNS client MUST discard
      the Error page URL EDNS0 option.

   When a DoH/DoT resolver receives an Error page URL EDNS0 option, the
   resolver MUST NOT forward the Error Page URL EDNS0 option from an
   upstream resolver as an attacker (e.g., MiTM) could insert a fake
   Error Page URL EDNS0 option into the DNS response.

   The agent acting as HTTPS client on the endpoint uses the URL as
   given by the DoH/DoT server in a HTTP GET request to retrieve the
   error page.  HTTP/2 [RFC7540] is the minimum RECOMMENDED version of
   HTTP to use to retrieve the error page.

5.  Sign and Verify

   The signature algorithms for generating signature for the entire DNS
   response message are defined in [DNSKEY-IANA].  The "mandatory-to-
   implement" algorithms are defined in [RFC8624] are RSA, ECDSA and
   EdDSA.  Along similar lines, the DoH/DoT server's end-entity
   certificate's public key and the algorithm with which the key can be
   used are RSA, ECDSA and EdDSA [RFC8446].

   The signature is generated by the DoH/DoT server using the entire DNS
   response message, private key of the DoH/DoT server's end-entity



Reddy, et al.           Expires February 13, 2021               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        DNS Access Denied Error Page           August 2020


   certificate as inputs to the signature algorithm.  The signature
   algorithm in the ERROR-PAGE-SIG-ALG field MUST match the algorithm
   with which the public key is used in the subjectPublicKeyInfo field
   in the DoH/DoT server's X.509 end-entity certificate.

   If the signature algorithm in the ERROR-PAGE-SIG-ALG field does not
   match the algorithm in the subjectPublicKeyInfo field in the DoH/DoT
   server's X.509 end-entity certificate in the TLS handshake of the
   DoH/DoT session, the DNS client MUST discard the Error page URL EDNS0
   option.  The DNS client verifies the signature using the signature in
   ERROR-PAGE-SIG-ALG field, entire DNS response message and DoH/DoT
   server's end-entity certificate's public key in the TLS handshake of
   DoH/DoT session as inputs to the signature algorithm.  For example,
   if Ed25519 is used, Ed25519 signature algorithm and verification of
   the Ed25519 signature are described in Sections 5.1.6 and 5.1.7 of
   [RFC8032], respectively.

6.  ERROR Page

   The following text outlines the RECOMMENDED contents of an error page
   to assist the operator developing the error page.

   o  The exact reason for blocking access to the domain.  If the domain
      is blocked based on some threat data, the threat type associated
      with the blocked domain can be provided/displayed to the end user.
      For example, the reason can indicate the type of malware blocked
      like spyware and the damage it can do the security and privacy of
      the user.

   o  The domain name blocked.

   o  If query was blocked by regulation, a pointer to a regulatory text
      that mandates this query block.

   o  The entity (or organization) blocking the access to the domain and
      contact details of the IT/InfoSec team to raise a complaint.

   o  The blocked error page to not include Ads and dynamic content.

   The content of the error page discussed above is non-normative, the

7.  Usability Considerations

   The error page SHOULD be returned in the user's preferred language as
   expressed by the Accept-Language header.  If the error page is
   displayed in a language not known to the end user and assuming
   Internationalization features failed, browser extensions to translate
   to user's native language can be used.  For example, "Google
   Translate" extension [Chrome-Translate] provided by Google on Chrome
   can be used by the user to translate the error page.  The "Google
   Translate" extension automatically detects whether the language of a
   page is different from the language the user has selected.  If it is
   in a different language, a banner appears at the top of the page.
   The user can click on the Translate button in the banner to have all
   the text on the page appear in the language selected by the user.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations in [I-D.ietf-dnsop-extended-error] and
   [RFC8624] need to be taken into consideration.

   Unless the Error page URL EDNS0 option that conveys the URL that
   provides additional information about the cause of blocking access to
   a domain is sent over DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484] or DNS-over-TLS
   (DoT) [RFC7858], the DNS response is susceptible to forgery.

   The agent acting as the HTTPS client on the endpoint MUST NOT fetch
   the URL unless DNS messages exchanged are cryptographically protected
   using DoH/DoT.  Bad actors can host DoH/DoT servers, and claim the
   servers offer privacy and filtering capability to block malware
   domains but exactly do the opposite to invade the security and
   privacy of the end user.  For example, this attack can be mitigated
   if the endpoint selects DoH/DoT servers hosted by well-known
   organizations (e.g., ISPs, organization for which a user works, etc.)
   or the user selects a DoH/DoT server with filtering capability pre-
   configured in the OS/Browser.

   The DNS client can learn the filtering capability of a DoH/DoT server
   using [I-D.reddy-add-server-policy-selection].
   [I-D.reddy-add-server-policy-selection] also discusses how a DNS
   client can authenticate it is connecting to a DoH/DoT server hosted
   by a specific organization (e.g., ISP).  This information is
   cryptographically signed to attest its authenticity.  It is
   particularly useful when the DoH/DoT server is insecurely discovered
   and prevents the client from connecting to an attacker's DoH/DoT
   server.

   In order to deal with malicious servers, because the client knows
   that it is accessing a error page URL, it can know not to send

   cookies (e.g., cookie store isolated in Safari for captive portals
   [Safari-Cookie]), not to send credentials, disable JavaScript, auto-
   enable private browsing mode for the error page or load the error
   page in a container isolated from other web activity (e.g., Facebook
   Container by Mozilla Firefox [Facebook-Container]), etc.

   The DoH/DoT session provides transport security for the interaction
   between the DNS client and server, but DNSSEC signing and validation
   is not possible for the Error Page URL EDNS0 option returning the
   error page URL.  For example, if access to a doman is blocked, the
   DoH/DoT resolver can rewrite the response to send NXDOMAIN error and
   Error page URL EDNS0 option in the DNS response, it will omit DNSSEC
   RRsets, because the modified responses cannot be verified by DNSSEC
   signatures.  However, the signature in the Error Page URL EDNS0
   option provides data origin authentication and the input to the
   signature generation process includes the entire DNS response message
   to provide randomness for each signature.  This is also intended to
   allow the DNS client to distinguish between servers that do not
   implement Error page URL EDNS0 option and is useful to detect Error
   page URL EDNS0 option insertion attack by an MiTM in the path between
   the DoH/DoT resolver and authoritative servers.  Nevertheless, the
   Error Page URL EDNS0 option returning the error page URL should be
   treated only as diagnostic information and MUST NOT alter DNS
   protocol processing.

   By design, the object referenced by the error page URL potentially
   exposes additional information about the DNS resolution process that
   may leak information.  An example of this is the reason for blocking
   the access to the domain name and the entity blocking access to the
   domain.
